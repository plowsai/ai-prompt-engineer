# AI Prompt Engineer 

<p> This is a rebuild of Matt Shumers GPT-PROMPT-ENGINEER. The reason I rebuilt it is because I wanted a simpler way to run all of it without having to run collab notebook </p>

## Install 

To install this globally 

```pip install .```

## Run 

This is to convert a large model to a small model
```pompt --xlxs``


## Disclaimer 

I only built this to make an existing repo simpler. All credit belongs to Matt Shumer
